# MaaS Controller

Control plane for the Models-as-a-Service (MaaS) platform. The controller has two main responsibilities:

1. **Tenant reconciler** — deploys and manages `maas-api` via Server-Side Apply (SSA). The controller image includes the kustomize manifests and renders them at runtime, applying namespace, image, and configuration overrides from the `Tenant` CR and environment variables.
2. **Subscription reconciler** — reconciles **MaaSModelRef**, **MaaSAuthPolicy**, and **MaaSSubscription** custom resources and creates the corresponding Kuadrant AuthPolicies and TokenRateLimitPolicies, plus HTTPRoutes where needed.

For a comparison of the old tier-based flow vs the new subscription flow, see [docs/old-vs-new-flow.md](docs/old-vs-new-flow.md).

## Architecture

### Tenant reconciler

The Tenant reconciler watches `Tenant` CRs and deploys `maas-api` into the target namespace. On startup the controller creates the default `AITenant/models-as-a-service`; the AITenant reconciler then creates or adopts `Tenant/default-tenant` in the MaaS subscription namespace. The reconciler:

- Renders the embedded kustomize overlay (`maas-api/deploy/overlays/odh`) with runtime parameters (namespace, image, TLS settings)
- Applies the rendered manifests via SSA with `ForceOwnership`, so the controller is the sole owner
- Deploys gateway default policies (`AuthPolicy` for deny-unauthenticated, `TokenRateLimitPolicy` for deny-unsubscribed)
- Annotates the `maas-api` AuthPolicy with `opendatahub.io/managed=false` to prevent the ODH operator from reverting customizations

The `RELATED_IMAGE_ODH_MAAS_API_IMAGE` environment variable controls which `maas-api` image the Tenant reconciler deploys. When set on the controller Deployment, it overrides the default image in the kustomize manifests.

#### Design decisions

**Namespace-scoped CR.** The `Tenant` CR is namespace-scoped (`models-as-a-service`), not cluster-scoped like other ODH component CRDs. CRD `spec.scope` is immutable — changing it after deployment requires deleting all CR instances and the CRD itself (brief MaaS outage, permanent operator migration code). Shipping namespace-scoped from `v1alpha1` avoids that cost entirely and enables future multi-tenancy (one `default-tenant` per namespace).

**Self-bootstrap singleton.** The controller creates `AITenant/models-as-a-service` on startup if it does not exist. The AITenant reconciler creates or adopts `default-tenant`; a CEL validation rule (`self.metadata.name == 'default-tenant'`) enforces exactly one Tenant per namespace. This is consistent with the ODH component lifecycle (DSC enables → operator deploys controller → controller creates CR) while keeping the platform workload lifecycle inside `maas-controller`.

**Config anchor.** The cluster-scoped `Config` named `default` is the Kubernetes controller owner for platform operands (maas-api workloads, gateway policies, cluster RBAC, and so on). Namespaced children in any namespace may reference this cluster-scoped owner. The namespace-scoped `Tenant` (`default-tenant`) is also owned by `Config` so garbage collection removes it when the anchor is deleted. **`Config/default` is created by `LifecycleReconciler`** once the `maas-controller` Deployment is running (and recreated if accidentally deleted while the Deployment remains); the ODH operator may still create it via component reconcile. The manager bootstrap runnable creates **`AITenant/models-as-a-service`** once `Config` exists (shell CR only); **`LifecycleReconciler`** applies non-controller **`Config`→`AITenant`** and **`Config`→`Tenant`** owner references the same way it links **`Config`→`Deployment`**. When the `Tenant` is set to `managementState: Removed`, teardown is driven by the **operator removing the `Config` anchor** (Models-as-a-Service component GC); the Tenant reconciler does not delete `Config`. The bootstrap runnable skips AITenant create while the **`maas-controller` Deployment is terminating**, matching the signal `LifecycleReconciler` uses so bootstrap does not fight teardown.

**RBAC (ODH reconciler).** `ClusterRole/maas-controller-role` is owned by the `ModelsAsService` component CR and the operator resets its rules to its embedded manifest, which may omit `configs` until the operator ships that API. A separate `ClusterRole` + `ClusterRoleBinding` (`maas-controller-cluster-config-role` → the same `maas-controller` ServiceAccount) grants only `configs` verbs and is not operator-owned, so it persists and merges at authorization time with the primary binding.

**Cross-namespace ownership.** The `Tenant` CR lives in the subscription namespace (default `models-as-a-service`), while `maas-api` runs in the application namespace (e.g. `opendatahub`). Kubernetes rejects a namespaced owner in a different namespace, so platform resources do **not** use `Tenant` as the controller owner. Instead they use `Config` as controller owner and carry tracking labels (`maas.opendatahub.io/tenant-name`, `maas.opendatahub.io/tenant-namespace`) for human inspection and for any non-owner-driven automation. Example labels:

```yaml
labels:
  maas.opendatahub.io/tenant-name: default-tenant
  maas.opendatahub.io/tenant-namespace: models-as-a-service
```

The `maas-controller` Deployment in the application namespace is never given a controller owner reference to itself; it only receives the tracking labels above when present in the rendered manifests.

### Subscription model

The controller implements a **dual-gate** model where both gates must pass for a request to succeed:

```text
User Request
    │
    ▼
Gateway (maas-default-gateway)
    │
    ├── Default deny AuthPolicy ──── 401/403 for unconfigured models
    ├── Default deny TokenRateLimitPolicy ──────── 429 safety net (defense-in-depth)
    │
    ▼
HTTPRoute (per model)
    │
    ├── Gate 1: AuthPolicy ──── "Is this user allowed to access this model?"
    │   └── Created from MaaSAuthPolicy → checks group membership → 401/403 on failure
    │
    ├── Gate 2: TokenRateLimitPolicy ──── "Does this user have a subscription?"
    │   └── Created from MaaSSubscription → enforces token limits → 429 on failure
    │
    ▼
Model Endpoint (200 OK)
```

Models with no MaaSAuthPolicy or MaaSSubscription are denied at the gateway level by `gateway-default-auth` (AuthPolicy, returns 401/403). Per-route policies created by the controller override the gateway defaults.

### CRDs and what they generate

As MaaS API and controller are conventionally deployed in the operator namespace (e.g., `opendatahub`), MaaS CRs need to be separated so that they can be managed with lower cluster privileges. Therefore,
- **MaaSModelRef** is located in the same namespace as the **HTTPRoute** and **LLMInferenceService** it refers to; and
- **MaaSAuthPolicy** and **MaaSSubscription** are located in a dedicated subscription namespace (default: `models-as-a-service`). Set `--maas-subscription-namespace` or the `MAAS_SUBSCRIPTION_NAMESPACE` env var in `maas-controller` deployment to use another namespace. MaaS controller will only watch and reconcile those CRs in this configured namespace.

| You create | Controller generates | Per | Targets |
| ---------- | -------------------- | --- | ------- |
| **MaaSModelRef** | (validates HTTPRoute) | 1 per model | References LLMInferenceService |
| **MaaSAuthPolicy** | Kuadrant **AuthPolicy** | 1 per model (aggregated from all auth policies) | Model's HTTPRoute |
| **MaaSSubscription** | Kuadrant **TokenRateLimitPolicy** | 1 per model (aggregated from all subscriptions) | Model's HTTPRoute |

Relationships are many-to-many: multiple MaaSAuthPolicies/MaaSSubscriptions can reference the same model — the controller aggregates them into a single Kuadrant policy per model. Multiple subscriptions for one model use mutually exclusive predicates with priority based on token limit (highest wins).

### Namespace scoping

**MaaSModelRef** resources can exist in any namespace. **MaaSAuthPolicy** and **MaaSSubscription** resources explicitly specify which namespace(s) their referenced models are in via `modelRefs[].namespace`.

Generated Kuadrant policies (AuthPolicy, TokenRateLimitPolicy) are always created **in the model's namespace**, not in the namespace of the MaaSAuthPolicy/MaaSSubscription that references it.

**Cross-namespace example:**

```yaml
# MaaSModelRef in the llm namespace
apiVersion: maas.opendatahub.io/v1alpha1
kind: MaaSModelRef
metadata:
  name: my-model
  namespace: llm
spec:
  modelRef:
    kind: LLMInferenceService
    name: my-llmisvc
---
# MaaSAuthPolicy in models-as-a-service namespace references model in llm namespace
apiVersion: maas.opendatahub.io/v1alpha1
kind: MaaSAuthPolicy
metadata:
  name: my-policy
  namespace: models-as-a-service
spec:
  modelRefs:
    - name: my-model
      namespace: llm    # Required: explicitly specify model's namespace
  subjects:
    groups:
      - name: my-group
```

The controller creates a Kuadrant **AuthPolicy** in the `llm` namespace (where the model and HTTPRoute exist), not in `models-as-a-service` (where the MaaSAuthPolicy lives).

**Same model name, different namespaces:**

Models with identical names in different namespaces are isolated. Each gets its own generated policies:

```yaml
# team-a/my-model and team-b/my-model are separate models
spec:
  modelRefs:
    - name: my-model
      namespace: team-a
    - name: my-model
      namespace: team-b
```

This creates two separate AuthPolicies: one in `team-a`, one in `team-b`.

**Model list API:** When the MaaS controller is installed, the MaaS API **GET /v1/models** endpoint lists models by reading **MaaSModelRef** CRs cluster-wide (all namespaces). Each MaaSModelRef's `metadata.name` becomes the model `id`, and `status.endpoint` / `status.phase` supply the URL and readiness. So the set of MaaSModelRef objects is the source of truth for "which models are available" in MaaS. See [docs/content/configuration-and-management/model-listing-flow.md](../docs/content/configuration-and-management/model-listing-flow.md) in the repo for the full flow.

### Model kinds and the provider pattern

MaaSModelRef's `spec.modelRef.kind` selects how the controller discovers and exposes the model. The controller uses a **provider pattern**: each kind has a **BackendHandler** (route reconciliation, status, endpoint resolution, cleanup) and a **RouteResolver** (HTTPRoute name/namespace for attaching AuthPolicy/TokenRateLimitPolicy). These are registered in `pkg/controller/maas/providers.go`.

| Kind (CRD value) | Behaviour |
| ---------------- | --------- |
| **LLMInferenceService** | Validates that an HTTPRoute exists for the referenced LLMInferenceService (created by KServe). Reads endpoint and readiness from the LLMInferenceService/HTTPRoute. |
| **ExternalModel** | References an [ExternalModel](../docs/content/reference/crds/external-model.md) CR that defines an external AI/ML provider (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic). The ExternalModel controller creates MaaS-prefixed networking resources (for example, HTTPRoute `maas-<model-name>`) in the same namespace while preserving the public path `/<namespace>/<model-name>`. MaaSModelRef validates the HTTPRoute exists and references the configured gateway, then derives the endpoint from the gateway's hostname. Model is ready once the HTTPRoute is accepted by the gateway. See `providers_external.go` for implementation. |

The CRD enum for `kind` is `LLMInferenceService` and `ExternalModel` (see `api/maas/v1alpha1/maasmodelref_types.go`). The registry accepts **LLMInferenceService**, **ExternalModel**, and the alias **llmisvc** (for backwards compatibility).

**Endpoint override:** MaaSModelRef supports an optional `spec.endpointOverride` field. When set, the controller uses this value for `status.endpoint` instead of the auto-discovered endpoint. This applies to all kinds and is useful when the discovered endpoint is wrong (e.g. wrong gateway or hostname). The controller still validates the backend normally — only the final endpoint URL is overridden.

### Adding a new provider

To support a new model kind (e.g. a new backend type):

1. **Extend the API (optional)**
   If the new kind needs extra fields (e.g. `endpoint` for ExternalModel), add them to `ModelReference` in `api/maas/v1alpha1/maasmodelref_types.go` and add the new value to the `Kind` enum. Run `make generate` and `make manifests` in the controller directory.

2. **Implement BackendHandler**  
   Create a new file (e.g. `providers_mykind.go`) and implement the `BackendHandler` interface:
   - **ReconcileRoute**: create/update the HTTPRoute for this model (or validate it exists), and optionally fill `model.Status` with route/gateway info.
   - **Status**: return `(endpointURL, ready, err)`. The controller sets `model.Status.Endpoint` and Phase (Ready/Pending/Failed) from this.
   - **CleanupOnDelete**: if your kind creates an HTTPRoute, delete it here; otherwise no-op.

3. **Implement RouteResolver**
   Implement the `RouteResolver` interface: **HTTPRouteForModel** should return the HTTPRoute name and namespace for the given MaaSModelRef. This is used by `findHTTPRouteForModel` and by the AuthPolicy/Subscription controllers to attach policies to the correct route.

4. **Register the provider**
   In `providers.go` `init()`, register both the handler and the resolver under the same kind string (the CRD enum value, e.g. `MyNewKind`):
   - `backendHandlerFactories["MyNewKind"] = func(r *MaaSModelRefReconciler) BackendHandler { return &myNewKindHandler{r} }`
   - `routeResolverFactories["MyNewKind"] = func() RouteResolver { return &myNewKindRouteResolver{} }`

5. **Tests**  
   Add tests in `providers_test.go`: `GetBackendHandler("MyNewKind", r)` and `GetRouteResolver("MyNewKind")` return non-nil; add tests for `findHTTPRouteForModel` with a fake client if useful. Run `make test`.

The controller will then route MaaSModelRefs with `spec.modelRef.kind: MyNewKind` to your handler. No changes are required in the main reconciler logic.

### Controller watches

The controller watches these resources and re-reconciles automatically:

| Watch | Triggers reconciliation of | Purpose |
| ----- | -------------------------- | ------- |
| MaaSModelRef changes | MaaSAuthPolicy, MaaSSubscription | Re-reconcile when model created/deleted |
| HTTPRoute changes | MaaSModelRef, MaaSAuthPolicy, MaaSSubscription | Re-reconcile when KServe creates a route (fixes startup race) |
| LLMInferenceService changes | MaaSModelRef | Re-reconcile when backend LLMInferenceService spec changes or Ready condition changes (fixes race where backend becomes ready after MaaSModelRef creation) |
| Generated AuthPolicy changes | Parent MaaSAuthPolicy | Overwrite manual edits (unless opted out) |
| Generated TokenRateLimitPolicy changes | Parent MaaSSubscription | Overwrite manual edits (unless opted out) |

### Lifecycle: Deletion behavior

**MaaSModelRef deleted:** The controller uses a finalizer to cascade-delete all generated AuthPolicies and TokenRateLimitPolicies for that model. The parent MaaSAuthPolicy and MaaSSubscription CRs remain intact. The underlying LLMInferenceService is not affected.

**MaaSSubscription deleted:** The aggregated TokenRateLimitPolicy for the model is deleted, then rebuilt from the remaining subscriptions. If no subscriptions remain, the model falls back to the gateway defaults (401/403 from auth if no MaaSAuthPolicy, or 429 from TokenRateLimitPolicy safety net if auth passes).

**MaaSAuthPolicy deleted:** Same pattern — the aggregated AuthPolicy is rebuilt from remaining auth policies.

### Multi-subscription priority

When multiple subscriptions target the same model, the controller sorts them by token limit (highest first) and builds mutually exclusive predicates. A user matching multiple subscription groups hits only the highest-limit rule:

```text
premium-user (50000 tkn/min): matches "in premium-user"
free-user    (100 tkn/min):   matches "in free-user AND NOT in premium-user"
deny-unsubscribed (0):        matches "NOT in premium-user AND NOT in free-user"
```

## Prerequisites

- OpenShift cluster with **Gateway API** and **Kuadrant/RHCL** installed
- **Open Data Hub** operator v3.3+ (for the `opendatahub` namespace and MaaS capability)
  - Note: RHOAI 3.2.0 does NOT support `modelsAsService` -- use ODH instead
- `kubectl` or `oc`
- `kustomize` (for examples)

## Authentication

Create API keys with `POST /v1/api-keys` on the maas-api (authenticate with your OpenShift token). Each key is bound to one MaaSSubscription at mint time: set `"subscription": "<name>"` in the JSON body, or omit it and the platform selects the **highest-priority** accessible subscription (`MaaSSubscription.spec.priority`).

```bash
MAAS_API="https://<gateway-host>/maas-api"
API_KEY=$(curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $(oc whoami -t)" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST -d '{"name":"demo","subscription":"<maas-subscription-name>"}' \
  "${MAAS_API}/v1/api-keys" | jq -r .key)

curl -sS "https://<gateway-host>/llm/<model-name>/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"<model>","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}],"max_tokens":10}'
```

**Important:** The group names in MaaSAuthPolicy and MaaSSubscription must match groups returned by the Kubernetes **TokenReview API** for your user's token. These come from your identity provider (OIDC, LDAP, htpasswd), **not** from OpenShift Group objects created via `oc adm groups`.

To check your token's groups:

```bash
# Create a temporary token and check what groups TokenReview returns
TOKEN=$(kubectl create token default -n default --duration=1m)
echo '{"apiVersion":"authentication.k8s.io/v1","kind":"TokenReview","spec":{"token":"'$TOKEN'"}}' | \
  kubectl create -o jsonpath='{.status.user.groups}' -f -
```

Common groups: `dedicated-admins`, `system:authenticated`, `system:authenticated:oauth`.

## Install

All commands below are meant to be run from the **repository root** (the directory containing `maas-controller/`).

### Option A: Full deploy (recommended)

Deploy the entire MaaS stack in one command. The script installs prerequisites (policy engine, Gateway, PostgreSQL, Authorino TLS) and deploys `maas-controller`, which then deploys `maas-api` via the Tenant reconciler:

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh --operator-type odh
```

### Option B: Add controller to an existing deployment

If MaaS infrastructure is already deployed, install just the controller (same kustomize root the ODH operator uses):

```bash
kubectl apply -k deployment/base/maas-controller/default
```

On a **fresh** cluster, applying the full bundle in one shot can apply workloads before MaaS CRDs are **Established**. **`./scripts/deploy.sh`** applies `deployment/base/maas-controller/crd` first and waits until every MaaS CRD is **Established**, then applies the rest of `deployment/base/maas-controller/default` (RBAC, Deployment, and so on). After the controller pod starts, **`LifecycleReconciler` creates `Config/default`** and links **`Config`→`Deployment`**, **`Config`→`AITenant/models-as-a-service`**, and **`Config`→`default-tenant`**; the bootstrap runnable may create the default **`AITenant`** shell before those owner refs converge.

To install into another namespace:

```bash
kustomize build deployment/base/maas-controller/default | sed "s/namespace: opendatahub/namespace: my-namespace/g" | kubectl apply -f -
```

For a cold cluster with a custom namespace, run `install_maas_controller_crds_and_wait` from `scripts/deployment-helpers.sh` before the `kustomize build … | kubectl apply` line (same order as `deploy.sh`).

### Verify

```bash
kubectl get pods -n opendatahub -l app=maas-controller
kubectl get crd | grep maas.opendatahub.io
```

### What gets installed

| Component | Path | Description |
| --------- | ---- | ----------- |
| CRDs (also in default kustomize) | `deployment/base/maas-controller/crd/bases/` | Config, Tenant, MaaSModelRef, MaaSAuthPolicy, MaaSSubscription, ExternalModel |
| Default bundle (operator) | `deployment/base/maas-controller/default/` | Includes `../crd` + RBAC + Deployment + monitoring + `Config/default` |
| RBAC | `deployment/base/maas-controller/rbac/` | ClusterRole, ServiceAccount, bindings |
| Controller | `deployment/base/maas-controller/manager/` | Deployment (`quay.io/opendatahub/maas-controller:latest`) |
| Default auth policy | `deployment/base/maas-controller/policies/` | Gateway-level AuthPolicy (deny unauthenticated, 401/403) |
| Default deny policy | `deployment/base/maas-controller/policies/` | Gateway-level TokenRateLimitPolicy with 0 tokens (deny unsubscribed, 429) |
| maas-api (via Tenant) | Embedded kustomize manifests | Deployed at runtime by the Tenant reconciler |

## Examples

Install both **regular** and **premium** simulator models and their MaaS policies/subscriptions (from the repository root):

```bash
# Create model namespace (models-as-a-service namespace is auto-created by controller)
kubectl create namespace llm --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
kustomize build docs/samples/maas-system | kubectl apply -f -
```

This creates:

### Regular tier

- `LLMInferenceService/facebook-opt-125m-simulated` in `llm` namespace
- `MaaSModelRef/facebook-opt-125m-simulated` in `llm`
- `MaaSAuthPolicy/simulator-access` (group: `free-user`) and `MaaSSubscription/simulator-subscription` (100 tokens/min) in `models-as-a-service`

### Premium tier

- `LLMInferenceService/premium-simulated-simulated-premium` in `llm` namespace
- `MaaSModelRef/premium-simulated-simulated-premium` in `llm`
- `MaaSAuthPolicy/premium-simulator-access` (group: `premium-user`) and `MaaSSubscription/premium-simulator-subscription` (1000 tokens/min) in `models-as-a-service`

Replace `free-user` and `premium-user` in the example CRs with groups from your identity provider.

Then verify:

```bash
# Check CRs
kubectl get maasmodelref -n llm
kubectl get maasauthpolicy,maassubscription -n models-as-a-service

# Check generated Kuadrant policies
kubectl get authpolicy,tokenratelimitpolicy -n llm

# Test inference (set GATEWAY_HOST and TOKEN once)
GATEWAY_HOST="maas.$(kubectl get ingresses.config.openshift.io cluster -o jsonpath='{.spec.domain}')"
MAAS_API="https://${GATEWAY_HOST}/maas-api"
TOKEN=$(oc whoami -t)

# Regular tier: log in as a user in free-user, then mint a key for simulator-subscription
FREE_API_KEY=$(curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST -d '{"name":"readme-free","subscription":"simulator-subscription"}' \
  "${MAAS_API}/v1/api-keys" | jq -r .key)

curl -sS -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" "https://${GATEWAY_HOST}/llm/facebook-opt-125m-simulated/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"model":"facebook/opt-125m","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hi"}],"max_tokens":5}'
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" "https://${GATEWAY_HOST}/llm/facebook-opt-125m-simulated/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $FREE_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"model":"facebook/opt-125m","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hi"}],"max_tokens":5}'

# Premium tier: log in as a user in premium-user, mint a key for premium-simulator-subscription, then call the premium route
PREMIUM_API_KEY=$(curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST -d '{"name":"readme-premium","subscription":"premium-simulator-subscription"}' \
  "${MAAS_API}/v1/api-keys" | jq -r .key)

curl -sS -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" "https://${GATEWAY_HOST}/llm/premium-simulated-simulated-premium/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"model":"facebook/opt-125m","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hi"}],"max_tokens":5}'
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" "https://${GATEWAY_HOST}/llm/premium-simulated-simulated-premium/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PREMIUM_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"model":"facebook/opt-125m","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hi"}],"max_tokens":5}'
```

See [docs/samples/maas-system/README.md](../docs/samples/maas-system/README.md) for more details.

## Opting out of controller management

By default, the controller owns generated AuthPolicies and TokenRateLimitPolicies: it overwrites manual edits on reconciliation and deletes them when the owning MaaS resource is removed. To opt a specific policy out of both behaviours, annotate it:

```bash
# AuthPolicy
kubectl annotate authpolicy <name> -n <namespace> opendatahub.io/managed=false

# TokenRateLimitPolicy
kubectl annotate tokenratelimitpolicy <name> -n <namespace> opendatahub.io/managed=false
```

Remove the annotation to re-enable controller management:

```bash
kubectl annotate authpolicy <name> -n <namespace> opendatahub.io/managed-
kubectl annotate tokenratelimitpolicy <name> -n <namespace> opendatahub.io/managed-
```

> **Warning: orphaned resources.** An opted-out policy can become permanently orphaned (no longer reconciled and not deleted) in the following situations:
>
> - **Last owner deleted.** When the last `MaaSAuthPolicy` or `MaaSSubscription` that references a model is deleted, the controller skips deletion of any opted-out generated policy for that model. The policy will persist until it is manually deleted.
> - **Model reference removed.** When a model is removed from a `MaaSAuthPolicy.spec.modelRefs` or `MaaSSubscription.spec.modelRefs` (edit rather than deletion), the controller does not clean up the generated policy for that model regardless of the opt-out annotation.
> - **MaasModel deleted.** When a MaaSModel is deleted, the controller's finalizer skips deletion of any opted-out generated policy for that model. The policy will persist until it is manually deleted.
>
> In all cases, manually delete the orphaned resource when it is no longer needed.

## Build and push image

The default deployment uses `quay.io/opendatahub/maas-controller:latest`.

The Dockerfile builds from the **repository root** context (not `maas-controller/`) because the controller image includes kustomize manifests from `maas-api/deploy/` and `deployment/`.

```bash
make -C maas-controller image-build                    # build with podman/buildah/docker (from repo root)
make -C maas-controller image-push                     # push to quay.io/opendatahub/maas-controller:latest (this image is created automatically on main branch, so preferably push images with different tag and/or to your temp registry if you are doing some testing and verification)

# Custom image/tag
make -C maas-controller image-build IMAGE=quay.io/myorg/maas-controller IMAGE_TAG=v0.1.0
make -C maas-controller image-push IMAGE=quay.io/myorg/maas-controller IMAGE_TAG=v0.1.0
```

## Development

From the repository root:

```bash
make -C maas-controller build      # build binary to maas-controller/bin/manager
make -C maas-controller run        # run locally (uses kubeconfig)
make -C maas-controller test       # run tests
make -C maas-controller install    # apply deployment/base/maas-controller/default to cluster
make -C maas-controller uninstall  # remove everything
```

### Regenerating after API changes

When you modify API types under `maas-controller/api/`, you **must** regenerate the deepcopy helpers and CRD manifests before committing:

```bash
make -C maas-controller generate manifests
```

This updates:

- `maas-controller/api/maas/v1alpha1/zz_generated.deepcopy.go` (deepcopy methods)
- `deployment/base/maas-controller/crd/bases/maas.opendatahub.io_*.yaml` (CRD schemas)

CI will fail if the generated files are out of date.

> **Note:** You don't need to install `controller-gen` manually - `make generate` and `make manifests` automatically install the correct pinned version to `bin/controller-gen`.

## Troubleshooting

### Understanding Status Phases

MaaSSubscription and MaaSAuthPolicy use these phases:

| Phase | Meaning |
| ----- | ------- |
| **Active** | All model references valid, all operands healthy |
| **Degraded** | Partial functionality — some models valid, others missing/invalid |
| **Failed** | No functionality — all model references invalid or missing |
| **Pending** | Transitional state — resources or model references are being created/updated and validity/health is not yet determined |

Check per-item status to identify specific issues:

```bash
# Find resources with issues
kubectl get maassubscription -n models-as-a-service -o jsonpath='{range .items[?(@.status.phase!="Active")]}{.metadata.name}{"\t"}{.status.phase}{"\n"}{end}'

# Check which model refs are failing
kubectl get maassubscription my-subscription -n models-as-a-service -o jsonpath='{.status.modelRefStatuses}' | jq .
```

### Common Issues

**MaaS CRs stuck in `Failed` state:**
The controller retries with exponential backoff. If the HTTPRoute doesn't exist yet (KServe still deploying), the CRs will auto-recover when it appears. If they stay stuck, check `status.modelRefStatuses` for `NotFound` reasons, or check controller logs:

```bash
kubectl logs deployment/maas-controller -n opendatahub --tail=20
```

**MaaS CRs in `Degraded` state:**
Some model references are invalid. Check `status.modelRefStatuses` (subscription) or `status.authPolicies` (auth policy) to identify which models are failing and why (`NotFound`, `NotAccepted`, `NotEnforced`).

**Auth returns 403 even though user is in the right group:**
The groups in MaaSAuthPolicy must match your identity provider's groups, not OpenShift Group objects. Check your actual token groups (see Authentication section above).

**Unauthenticated requests return 200 instead of 401:**
The gateway-auth-policy may still be active. From the repository root run `NAMESPACE=opendatahub maas-controller/hack/disable-gateway-auth-policy.sh` (check both `opendatahub` and `openshift-ingress` namespaces).

**Kuadrant policies show `Enforced: False`:**
Check that the WasmPlugin exists: `kubectl get wasmplugins -n openshift-ingress`. If missing, ensure RHCL (not community Kuadrant) is installed from the `redhat-operators` catalog.

## Configuration

### CLI Flags

The controller accepts the following command-line flags:

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--metrics-bind-address` | `:8080` | The address the metrics endpoint binds to. |
| `--health-probe-bind-address` | `:8081` | The address the probe endpoint binds to. |
| `--leader-elect` | `false` | Enable leader election for controller manager. |
| `--gateway-name` | `maas-default-gateway` | The name of the Gateway resource to use for model HTTPRoutes. |
| `--gateway-namespace` | `openshift-ingress` | The namespace of the default Gateway resource and existing Gateways referenced by AITenant resources. |
| `--maas-api-namespace` | `opendatahub` | The namespace where maas-api service is deployed. |
| `--maas-subscription-namespace` | `models-as-a-service` | The namespace to watch for MaaSAuthPolicy, MaaSSubscription and Tenant CRs. |
| `--aitenant-namespace` | `ai-tenants` | The infrastructure namespace where AITenant CRs are accepted. |
| `--metadata-cache-ttl` | `60` | TTL in seconds for Authorino metadata HTTP caching (apiKeyValidation, subscription-info). |
| `--authz-cache-ttl` | `60` | TTL in seconds for Authorino OPA authorization caching (auth-valid, subscription-valid, require-group-membership). |
| `--subscription-namespace-maintain-interval` | `30s` | How often to re-check controller-managed namespaces while the manager is running. |
| `--enable-tenant-namespace-discovery` | `false` | When enabled, watch MaaS CRs in all namespaces and reconcile the configured `--maas-subscription-namespace` plus tenant namespaces labeled `ai-gateway.opendatahub.io/tenant` or `maas.opendatahub.io/managed-by-aitenant=true`. |

### Other Configuration

- **Controller namespace**: Default is `opendatahub`. Override via `kustomize build deployment/base/maas-controller/default | sed "s/namespace: opendatahub/namespace: <ns>/g" | kubectl apply -f -`.
- **MaaS subscription namespace**: Default is `models-as-a-service`. Override via the `--maas-subscription-namespace` flag.
- **AITenant infrastructure namespace**: Default is `ai-tenants`. The controller creates it if missing. Override via the `--aitenant-namespace` flag.
- **AITenant tenant namespace**: For non-default tenants, the controller derives the tenant namespace as `ai-tenant-<aitenant-name>`. The default tenant keeps the configured MaaS subscription namespace, usually `models-as-a-service`.
- **Image**: Default is `quay.io/opendatahub/maas-controller:latest`. Override the live `maas-controller` Deployment image directly.
- **Gateway name/namespace**: Legacy/unmanaged Tenant routing uses `spec.gatewayRef` with controller defaults. AITenant-managed tenants use the owning `AITenant` as the platform context source: `spec.gateway.name` is intent, `status.gatewayRef` is the resolved Gateway, and the bridge `Tenant.spec.gatewayRef` is ignored.
- **External OIDC**: For AITenant-managed tenants, configure OIDC on `AITenant.spec.oidc`. Existing `Tenant.spec.externalOIDC` values are preserved for compatibility but ignored once the Tenant is AITenant-managed.
