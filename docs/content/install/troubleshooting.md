# Troubleshooting

This guide helps you diagnose and resolve common issues with MaaS Platform deployments.

## Common Issues

1. **Getting `501` Not Implemented errors**: Traffic is not making it to the Gateway.
      - [ ] Verify Gateway status and HTTPRoute configuration
2. **Getting `401` Unauthorized errors when trying to create an API key**: Authentication to maas-api is not working.
      - [ ] Verify `maas-api-auth-policy` AuthPolicy is applied
      - [ ] Check if your cluster uses a custom token review audience:

      ```bash
      # Detect your cluster's audience
      AUD="$(kubectl create token default --duration=10m 2>/dev/null | \
        cut -d. -f2 | jq -Rr '@base64d | fromjson | .aud[0]' 2>/dev/null)"
      echo "Cluster audience: ${AUD}"
      ```

      If the audience is NOT `https://kubernetes.default.svc`, patch the AuthPolicy:

      ```bash
      kubectl patch authpolicy maas-api-auth-policy -n opendatahub \
        --type=merge --patch "
      spec:
        rules:
          authentication:
            openshift-identities:
              kubernetesTokenReview:
                audiences:
                  - ${AUD}
                  - maas-default-gateway-sa"
      ```

3. **Getting `401` errors when trying to get models**: Authentication is not working for the models endpoint.
      - [ ] Create a new API key and use it in the Authorization header
      - [ ] Verify `gateway-auth-policy` AuthPolicy is applied
      - [ ] Validate that the service account has `post` access to the `llminferenceservices` resource per MaaSAuthPolicy
        - Note: this should be automated by the ODH Controller
4. **Getting `404` errors when trying to get models**: The models endpoint is not working.
      - [ ] Verify `model-route` HTTPRoute exist and is applied
      - [ ] Verify the model is deployed and the `LLMInferenceService` has the `maas-default-gateway` gateway specified
      - [ ] Verify that the model is recognized by maas-api by checking the `maas-api/v1/models` endpoint (see [Validation Guide - List Available Models](validation.md#3-list-available-models))
5. **Rate limiting not working**: Verify AuthPolicy and TokenRateLimitPolicy are applied
      - [ ] Verify `gateway-rate-limits` RateLimitPolicy is applied
      - [ ] Verify TokenRateLimitPolicy is applied (e.g. gateway-default-deny or per-route policies)
      - [ ] If **multiple** TokenRateLimitPolicies target the **same** HTTPRoute, see [Quota and Access Configuration](../configuration-and-management/quota-and-access-configuration.md)
      - [ ] Verify the model is deployed and the `LLMInferenceService` has the `maas-default-gateway` gateway specified
      - [ ] Verify that the model is rate limited for request bursts (request-rate limiting) — see [Validation Guide - Test Rate Limiting](validation.md#7-test-rate-limiting)
      - [ ] Verify that the model returns 429 for token-heavy prompts (token-rate limiting) — see [Validation Guide - Test Rate Limiting](validation.md#7-test-rate-limiting)
6. **Routes not accessible (503 errors)**: Check MaaS Default Gateway status and HTTPRoute configuration
      - [ ] Verify Gateway is in `Programmed` state: `kubectl get gateway -n openshift-ingress maas-default-gateway`
      - [ ] Check HTTPRoute configuration and status

7. **High-concurrency inference returns intermittent `500` or `503` errors**: The RHCL/Kuadrant WASM authentication path may be timing out under burst load.
      - [ ] Confirm the errors occur during concurrent request scenarios and not for low-volume requests
      - [ ] Increase `AUTH_SERVICE_TIMEOUT` from the default `200ms` to `2s` through the RHCL operator Subscription configuration. See [High-concurrency authentication timeout](platform-setup.md#high-concurrency-authentication-timeout).

8. **Metrics not appearing in dashboards**: Prometheus is not scraping MaaS components.
      - [ ] Verify User Workload Monitoring is enabled — see [Observability Setup](../observability/setup.md#user-workload-monitoring)
      - [ ] Verify Kuadrant observability is enabled — see [Observability Setup](../observability/setup.md#kuadrant-observability)
      - [ ] Check prometheus-user-workload pods are running:

      ```bash
      kubectl get pods -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring
      ```

      - [ ] Verify ServiceMonitors/PodMonitors exist:

      ```bash
      kubectl get servicemonitor,podmonitor -A | grep -E "(maas|kuadrant|limitador)"
      ```

9. **Rate limiting metrics missing (authorized_calls, limited_calls)**: Kuadrant observability is not enabled.
      - [ ] Enable observability on Kuadrant CR:

      ```bash
      kubectl patch kuadrant kuadrant -n kuadrant-system --type=merge \
        -p '{"spec":{"observability":{"enable":true}}}'
      ```

      - [ ] Verify the PodMonitor was created:

      ```bash
      kubectl get podmonitor -n kuadrant-system
      ```

10. **RHOAI Dashboard Observability tab returns `503 Service Unavailable`**: The Dashboard cannot reach the Perses backend.

      The error typically appears as `{"statusCode": 503, "code": "FST_REPLY_FROM_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE", ...}`.
      This is a Fastify/Dashboard-level error (not a gateway 503) indicating the monitoring stack
      is not deployed or Perses is not running. The most common causes are missing operators (COO,
      OpenTelemetry) or DSCI `monitoring.metrics` not being configured.

      See [RHOAI Dashboard Observability Tab](../observability/setup.md#rhoai-dashboard-observability-tab-optional) for the full prerequisites and verification checklist.

11. **GenAI Studio tab not visible in Dashboard**: Requires `llamastackoperator` set to `Managed` in the DSC and the `genAiStudio` feature flag enabled on `OdhDashboardConfig`.

      See [OdhDashboardConfig Feature Flags](maas-setup.md#odhdashboardconfig-feature-flags) for setup.

12. **TLS certificate errors (`curl: (60) SSL certificate problem`)**: Your cluster uses self-signed or internal CA certificates that are not in your system trust store. See [TLS Certificate Validation](#tls-certificate-validation) below.

13. **Cannot create MaaSSubscription or MaaSAuthPolicy (`no endpoints available for service "maas-controller-webhook-service"`)**: The maas-controller pods are not running or not ready.

      MaaS uses admission webhooks to validate resource creation. When the controller is unavailable (pod crash, upgrade, or scaled to 0), the webhook endpoint becomes unreachable and creates are rejected.

      - [ ] Check controller pod status:

      ```bash
      kubectl get pods -n models-as-a-service -l control-plane=maas-controller
      ```

      - [ ] Check webhook service endpoints:

      ```bash
      kubectl get endpoints maas-controller-webhook-service -n models-as-a-service
      ```

      - [ ] Check controller logs for errors:

      ```bash
      kubectl logs -n models-as-a-service deployment/maas-controller
      ```

      Creates succeed once controller pods are healthy. Model inference requests are unaffected during controller downtime (data plane continues operating normally).

14. **Cannot create `AITenant` (`must be created in the configured AITenant infrastructure namespace`)**: The object is being created outside the namespace configured by `--aitenant-namespace` (default `ai-tenants`).

      - [ ] Check which namespace the controller is configured to accept:

      ```bash
      kubectl get deployment maas-controller -n opendatahub -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].args}'
      ```

      - [ ] Create the `AITenant` in that namespace instead of the target tenant namespace:

      ```bash
      kubectl get namespace ai-tenants
      ```

      - [ ] If the error is `no endpoints available for service "maas-controller-webhook-service"`, follow the same webhook health checks as issue 12 above.

## Conflicting AuthPolicy Detection

MaaS automatically detects non-MaaS AuthPolicies (e.g., from KServe or other controllers) that target the same HTTPRoutes used by MaaS-governed models. When a conflict is detected, MaaS sets a `ConflictingAuthPolicy` condition on the affected MaaSAuthPolicy resource and emits a Kubernetes warning event.

### Symptoms

- MaaSAuthPolicy has condition `ConflictingAuthPolicy=True`
- Warning events on MaaSAuthPolicy resources referencing non-MaaS AuthPolicies
- Unexpected authentication behavior (wrong policy may win when multiple AuthPolicies target the same HTTPRoute)

### Diagnosis

Check for conflicting AuthPolicy conditions:

```bash
# Check MaaSAuthPolicy conditions
kubectl get maasauthpolicy -n models-as-a-service -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{"\t"}{range .status.conditions[?(@.type=="ConflictingAuthPolicy")]}{.status}{"\t"}{.message}{end}{"\n"}{end}'

# List all AuthPolicies targeting a specific model's HTTPRoute
MODEL_NS="<model-namespace>"
MODEL_NAME="<model-name>"
kubectl get authpolicy -n "$MODEL_NS" -o json | \
  jq -r ".items[] | select(.spec.targetRef.name == \"$MODEL_NAME\" and .spec.targetRef.kind == \"HTTPRoute\") | .metadata.name + \" (managed-by: \" + (.metadata.labels[\"app.kubernetes.io/managed-by\"] // \"unknown\") + \")\""

# Check for warning events
kubectl get events -n models-as-a-service --field-selector reason=ConflictingAuthPolicy
```

### Remediation

1. **KServe anonymous auth policies** (`*-kserve-route-authn`): These are typically created when `security.opendatahub.io/enable-auth` is misconfigured on the InferenceService. Set the annotation to `"true"` on MaaS-governed InferenceServices to prevent KServe from creating conflicting anonymous AuthPolicies:

    ```bash
    kubectl annotate inferenceservice <name> -n <namespace> \
      security.opendatahub.io/enable-auth="true" --overwrite
    ```

2. **Custom AuthPolicies**: If another team deployed a custom AuthPolicy targeting the same HTTPRoute, coordinate to determine which controller should own authentication for that route. Either:
      - Remove the conflicting AuthPolicy if MaaS is the intended auth authority
      - Or remove the model from the MaaSAuthPolicy if MaaS should not govern that route

3. **Verify resolution**: After applying the fix, the `ConflictingAuthPolicy` condition should transition to `False` on the next reconciliation:

    ```bash
    kubectl get maasauthpolicy -n models-as-a-service -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{": "}{range .status.conditions[?(@.type=="ConflictingAuthPolicy")]}{.status}{end}{"\n"}{end}'
    ```

## TLS Certificate Validation

By default, `curl` validates TLS certificates against your system CA bundle. If you encounter certificate verification errors (e.g., `curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: self-signed certificate`), use one of the approaches below.

### Recommended: Use the Ingress CA/Certificate Chain

For OpenShift clusters with self-signed or internal certificates, use the ingress trust chain (or your platform-provided CA bundle) with `curl --cacert`:

```bash
# Get ingress certificate chain/trust bundle (platform-specific source)
oc get secret -n openshift-ingress router-certs-default \
  -o jsonpath='{.data.tls\.crt}' | base64 -d > /tmp/ingress-cert-chain.crt

# Use --cacert in curl commands
curl -sS --cacert /tmp/ingress-cert-chain.crt \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  "https://maas.${CLUSTER_DOMAIN}/maas-api/v1/models" | jq .
```

Alternatively, if your cluster uses the OpenShift service CA:

```bash
# Extract the service CA bundle
oc get configmap -n openshift-config-managed service-ca-bundle \
  -o jsonpath='{.data.service-ca\.crt}' > /tmp/service-ca.crt

# Use --cacert in curl commands
curl -sS --cacert /tmp/service-ca.crt \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  "https://maas.${CLUSTER_DOMAIN}/maas-api/v1/models" | jq .
```

### Development/Testing Only: Disable Verification

!!! danger "Security Warning"
    The `-k` flag disables all TLS certificate validation. An attacker on the network path can present a forged certificate and intercept your API key, token, or other credentials. **Never use `-k` in production or when sending credentials over untrusted networks.**

For **isolated development or test environments only**, you can add the `-k` flag:

```bash
# INSECURE: Only for isolated dev/test environments
curl -sS -k -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  "https://maas.${CLUSTER_DOMAIN}/maas-api/v1/models" | jq .
```

### Adding the CA to Your System Trust Store

For a permanent solution, add the ingress certificate chain to your system trust store so that all tools (curl, Python, browsers) trust it automatically:

```bash
# Linux (Fedora/RHEL)
sudo cp /tmp/ingress-cert-chain.crt /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
sudo update-ca-trust

# Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo cp /tmp/ingress-cert-chain.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/ingress-cert-chain.crt
sudo update-ca-certificates

# macOS
sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot \
  -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain /tmp/ingress-cert-chain.crt
```

For detailed TLS configuration options, see [TLS Configuration](../configuration-and-management/tls-configuration.md).
