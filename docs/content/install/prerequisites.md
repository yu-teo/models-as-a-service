# MaaS Installation Overview

_Models-as-a-Service_ is compatible with the Open Data Hub project (ODH) and
Red Hat OpenShift AI (RHOAI). MaaS is installed by enabling it in the DataScienceCluster resource:

* [Install your platform](platform-setup.md) (ODH or RHOAI operators and DSCInitialization).
* [Install MaaS Components](maas-setup.md) (Database, Gateways, DataScienceCluster).

## Version Compatibility

| MaaS Version | OCP | Kuadrant (ODH) / RHCL (RHOAI) | Gateway API |
|--------------|-----|-------------------------------|-------------|
| v0.0.2       | 4.19.9+ | v1.3+ / v1.2+             | v1.2+       |
| v0.1.0       | 4.19.9+ | v1.3+ / v1.2+             | v1.2+       |

!!! note "Other Kubernetes flavors"
    Other Kubernetes flavors (e.g., upstream Kubernetes, other distributions) are currently being validated.



## Required Tools

The following tools are used across the installation guides:

* `kubectl` or `oc` — cluster access
* `curl` — used by Operator Setup (ODH/LWS)
* `jq` — used for validation and version parsing
* `kustomize` — used for Gateway AuthPolicy (MaaS Components)
* `envsubst` — used for policy templates (MaaS Components)

## Requirements for Open Data Hub project

MaaS requires Open Data Hub version 3.0 or later, with the Model Serving component
enabled (KServe) and properly configured for deploying models with `LLMInferenceService`
resources.

A specific requirement for MaaS is to set up ODH's Model Serving with Kuadrant v1.3+, even
though ODH can work with earlier Kuadrant versions.

## Requirements for Red Hat OpenShift AI

MaaS requires Red Hat OpenShift AI (RHOAI) version 3.0 or later, with the Model Serving
component enabled (KServe) and properly configured for deploying models with
`LLMInferenceService` resources.

A specific requirement for MaaS is to set up RHOAI Model Serving with Red Hat Connectivity
Link (RHCL) v1.2+, even though RHOAI can work with earlier RHCL versions.
